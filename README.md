Rescuer was a game project created in my CMPT276 Game Project. It was created with 2 classmates, Myron and Stephanie in the Spring of 2021. 

As the repositories at SFU Gitlab are private, I've taken the time to import all the files from Gitlab, and to also attached screenshots that contains project information from Gitlab that is not publically available.

Commits:

Josh: 112 commits | 
Myron: 75 commits | 
Stephanie: 29 commits | Rest are initial file commits
